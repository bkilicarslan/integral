📊 Integral Master: Calculus Visualizer
Integral Master is an interactive web application built with Python that allows users to calculate and visualize the definite integral of mathematical functions. By combining symbolic computation with high-quality plotting, it provides both the exact mathematical result and a clear visual representation of the area under the curve.

🚀 Features
Symbolic Math: Parses complex mathematical expressions (e.g., sin(x) + x**2) using SymPy.

Interactive Plots: Uses Plotly for zooming, panning, and hovering over data points.

Latex Rendering: Displays the integral notation and symbolic steps in a beautiful, academic format.

Instant Metrics: Get the numerical value of the integral immediately as you change parameters.

Responsive UI: Built with Streamlit for a clean, sidebar-driven user experience.
